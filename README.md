Obsolete

///modified: PageF/JSON.txt
This file is a placeholder of "Job-Scrapper.py"'s results. Once i integrate the
code right in Flask it will be deleted.

///added: PageF/templates/placeholder.html
This text was first inside "Job-Viewer.html", was moved to be inside an iframe.

///modified: PageF/routes.py 
Added "placeholder.html" to routes.

///modified: PageF/templates/Job-Viewer.html.
Made several changes that make the page more functional, now being fully able to open links inside JSON. Sidebar hasbeen improved
Sidebars now are almost fully responsive, just need to add max-height to sublists. 
Now every link makes an iframe.
Things to take care:
-Fix Sidebar Scroll of items adding max-height, add style and design.
-Add a link as an alternative to the i frame.
